# player-detection

Signal, Image and Video project course with prof. Andrea Rosani.
A.Y. 2023 / 2024
Lorenzo Gandini

The goal of this project is to create a player detection in a short video, and compare two methods:
1. Detection with HOG and MeanShift (?)
2. Detection with YOLO

One is done to demonstrate the full comprehension of the topic along the course. The second one is usefull to know since it is the standard the facto in modern computer vision
