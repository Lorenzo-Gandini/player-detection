HOG makes a good prediciton of players.
there's to implement camshift with Kalman. If i hard-code camshift, works well. With an iteration there's some problems.
There is to check the masks, probably red and yellow cause some mistakes.

1. Camshift with players, one at time and store the video, in order to understand how does it work

2. Camshift with one player red and one player yellow

3. try camshift with multiple players

3. Camshift and kalman togheter for 1 player

4. Camshift and kalman togheter for 2 player of different color

5. multiple items
